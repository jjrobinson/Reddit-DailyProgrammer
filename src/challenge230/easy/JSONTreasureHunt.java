/**
 * [2015-08-31] Challenge #230 [Easy] JSON treasure hunt
 * submitted 4 months ago * by XenophonOfAthens2 1
 * Description
 * 
 * One of the most common ways for computers to communicate with each other
 * today, especially over the internet, is a format known as JSON. JSON stands
 * for JavaScript Object Notation and has it's origins in JavaScript, but
 * nowadays libraries exist to parse it in pretty much every language in common
 * use. JSON is a pretty great tool for this, because it is very compact and
 * easily parsable, yet it's also very easy for humans to read and write.
 * There are 6 different fundamental types in JSON:
 * null, which usually signifies the absence of a value
 * A number, like 3, 4, 5 or 2.718281828 (JSON makes no distinction between
 * integers and floats)
 * A boolean, either true or false
 * A string, some number of characters between quotation marks: "hello world",
 * for instance
 * A list, which is an ordered list of JSON values: [1, 3.14, [null,
 * "popsicle"], false] for instance.
 * An "object", which is an unordered list of key-value pairs. The keys are
 * always strings, and the values can be any JSON object: {"key1": [1,2,3],
 * "key2": {"nestedKey": 14}}, for instance.
 * In strict JSON, the "root" is always an object. Here's a JSON document for
 * demonstration:
 * {
 *     "name": "William Shakespeare",
 *     "birthYear" : 1564,
 *     "dead" : true,
 *     "deathYear" : 1616,
 *     "selectedWorks" : [
 *         {
 *             "name" : "The Tragedy of Macbeth",
 *             "written" : 1606,
 *             "isItAwesome" : true
 *         },
 *         {
 *             "name" : "Coriolanus",
 *             "written" : 1608,
 *             "isItAwesome" : "It's alright, but kinda fascist-y"
 *         }
 *     ],
 *     "wife" : {
 *         "name" : "Anne Hathaway",
 *         "birthYear" : 1555,
 *         "dead" : false,
 *         "deathYear" : "Fun fact, she's a vampire"
 *     },
 *     "favoriteWebsites" : [
 *         "dailysonneter",
 *         "dailyprogrammer",
 *         "vine (he's way into 6-second cat videos)"
 *     ],
 *     "facebookProfile" : null
 * }
 * Note that this JSON document has been pretty-printed, which means that a
 * bunch of spaces and indentation has been added in to make it look nicer, but
 * they make no difference. Whitespace that is outside a string has no meaning
 * in JSON.
 * If you wish to find the name of the first play in the list of selected works,
 * you could say that the "path" to it looks something like this:
 * selectedWorks -> 0 -> name
 * You would say that the value located at this path is "The Tragedy of
 * Macbeth". The value "dailyprogrammer" is located at:
 * favoriteWebsites -> 1
 * Notice that JSON lists are zero-based, so the first item in the list has
 * index 0.
 * Your challenge today is as follows: you will be given a JSON object, and you
 * will print out the search path that leads to the value "dailyprogrammer". You
 * are allowed to use any JSON parsing libraries that you want to, today's
 * challenge is not about parsing JSON, it's about finding a key hidden in a
 * JSON object. If you wish to write a parser yourself, you are of course
 * allowed to do so (though I personally think that would be a little nuts), but
 * you are absolutely not required to do so in any way.
 * 
 * Formal inputs & outputs
 * 
 * Inputs
 * The input will be a JSON document which contains the string "dailyprogrammer"
 * somewhere as a value. The JSON document is guaranteed to be valid and use no
 * non-ASCII characters.
 * 
 * Outputs
 * The search-path for the string "dailyprogrammer", in the format described
 * above. Each "element" of the path will either be an integer (if it's indexing
 * a list) or a string (if it's indexing an object). The elements should be
 * joined together with " -> " between them.
 * 
 * Sample inputs & outputs
 * 
 * Input 1
 * {"name": "William Shakespeare", "wife": {"birthYear": 1555, "deathYear": 
 * "Fun fact, she's a vampire", "name": "Anne Hathaway", "dead": false},

 * "vine (he's way into 6-second cat videos)"], "dead": true, "birthYear": 1564, 
 * "facebookProfile": null, "selectedWorks": [{"written": 1606, "name": 
 * "The Tragedy of Macbeth", "isItAwesome": true}, {"written": 1608, "name": 
 * "Coriolanus", "isItAwesome": "It's alright, but kinda fascist-y"}],
